HTML Practice

For this project, I created a website that contains links to three different recipes. 
This project required the following skills:

1) HTML
2) Git
3) Bash
4) VS Code

Regarding HTML, I demonstrated my recently acquired skills of setting up an HTML boilerplate, working with text and setting up relative links between web pages. 

I believe the most challenging part of this project was to get used to working with Git, and putting into practice the best practices learned from the previous lessons, and obviously working with Git through the command line. I tried to be aware as much as possible when to commit changes to Git, and of how to comment on Git commits, because I know that this skill will set me apart as a developer.. I only figured out how to write commit descriptions using the VS Code text editor on my last commit, because I did not originally write the command to allow this to be possible. I am also still learning when to commit some files in the project vs others, but this is slowly starting to be clear to me. As I write this, I still need to add and commit this README.md file, then push to Git. I also still need to access the site from github once done as a final step of this project. I have definitely learned a lot about git in this project, and tried to make it more about that because the html portion was very straight forward for me. 

My command line skills with Bash are improving as well. I still have not performed any major tasks such as renaming a large amount of files at once, however I always use the command line to create and access files and directories, and obviously I am also using the command line for git. I am definitely keeping my command line skills sharp because of this.

I am becoming more familiar with VS Code. I am now comfortable with using the VS Code terminal, opening and managing files in a project, writing to files, writing git comments, downloading extensions, ect.
